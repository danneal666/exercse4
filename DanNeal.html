                <p>My name is Dan Neal. I'm 37 years old, I'm Married with three children.
                    My three children are all boys aged six, ten and thirteen. I have a large family and we love meeting
                    up as often as we can for barbecues, holidays, trips to the seaside etc.

                    I currently work for Sky as a DTH and FTTP engineer, before I started with sky I was in the Prison
                    Service for 11 years working at HMP Bedford and HMP Long Lartin. I hope to be able to use my new
                    skills to further my career at Sky in a different way whilst future proofing my knowledge base. I
                    have always been obsessed with technology and gadgets and love looking in to how things work and
                    different ways of making them better.

                <h1>Hobbies</h1>

                <p> I am an avid NFL fan following the New York Jets, I've loved the NFL since I was about 12. I was
                    lucky enough to play American Football from the age of around 18 all the way up until last year just
                    after my 37th birthday. I am also a big table top gamer, my game of choice
                    being Warhammer 40,000. Warhammer 40,000 is a fantasy table top wargame set in the future. As a
                    hobby you have to build the models, paint them and then once they are ready you are able to use them
                    in battles against other players. My two youngest sons have recently taken an interest in the hobby
                    too so its nice to be able to share my passion for this great hobby with them. </p>
